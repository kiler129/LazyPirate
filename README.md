# TorrentGhost
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kiler129/TorrentGhost.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kiler129/TorrentGhost) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/kiler129/TorrentGhost/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/kiler129/TorrentGhost)  
Did you ever been so lazy that you watched your favourite tv show few days later just because you struggled to download it? Now you can be lazy again - your show will be downloaded automatically.
This little tool can check RSS feeds, files on server or IRC channels (using `irssi` log) for new releases and download torrents for them.

## Current state
Project is under development. More details soon.
